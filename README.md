Welcome to my personal website! This website was built using Next.js for the frontend and Express.js for the backend.

## About the Project

My personal website serves as an online portfolio of my work, skills, and interests. The website has several pages, including a home page, a contact page, a projects page and about me.

### Technologies Used

- Next.js: A popular React framework for building server-side rendered (SSR) web applications.
- Express.js: A flexible and minimalist Node.js web application framework for building APIs and web applications.
- CSS Modules: A CSS management system for modular and reusable CSS in web applications.
- Git: A distributed version control system for managing the source code of the project.

### Features

- Server-side rendering (SSR) of web pages for improved performance and SEO.
- Dynamic routing and page generation using Next.js's built-in routing system.
- Custom API routes for handling backend logic and data storage using Express.js.
- Responsive design and layout using CSS modules and Flexbox.
- Deployed using [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) and [Cyclic](https://www.cyclic.sh/) for easy scaling and management.
